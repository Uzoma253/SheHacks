    <h3>My She Hacks Experience</h3>
    <h2>It was a splendid experience</h2>
    <h4>I learned the HTML element using the bracket app</h4>
    <p>The first class which was handled by Mrs. Funke was fun because role play was infused into the lecture</p>
    <h5>the first lecturer asked that we act a scene based on how the internet works</h5>
    <h6>and my group was the best at portraying what the internet is all about</h6>
   
    <p> Afterwards, Mr. Obafemi came after the break to teach HTML, which is basically what I am doing here using the Bracket app. This is the second paragragh i am creating. I have basically acquired the knowledge of heading, font size and paragraph</p>

      <center><h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1></center>

    This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.

      <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <ol><li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
          <li>175g of tahini</li>
          <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
          <li>Half a red pepper</li>
          <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
          <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
          <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
</ol>
      <p> <h3>Instructions</h3> </p>

    <ul style= list-style-type:lower-latin > 
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
        <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time: If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li></ul>

    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

    <h3>Storage</h3>

    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
