        <center><h1>KIDS CAN CODE</h1></center>
        <p style="align-items: stretch">Kids Can Code creates an atmosphere for kids between the ages of 3 and 15 to learn programming languages using world class materials found online or taught in a traditional classroom setting; on one on one basis. </p>
        <p> Learning is done via songs, role-play, fun and games. This method is used to attract the attention of the kids for a longer period of time without being fatigued or wornout.</p>
        <p>Kids are taught by tutors who have acquired both the knowledge of coding and as well as the montessori education using objects and things found in their immediate environment to learn.</p>
        <p> The environment is condusive for learning, well air-conditioned classrooms and beautiful atmosphere filled with trees and grasses that makes the kids feel close to nature.</p>

        <p>We encourage parents to register their kids early enough so that as they grow, coding will be inculcated into their daily life. this is because technology is taking over the world and kids should not be left behind.</p>
