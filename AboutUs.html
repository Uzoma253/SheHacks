        <aside><p>This program was created in 2021 by Uzoma Uzoegwu, who is a Software Developper for Andela. It was the urgent need to train many developpers in Nigeria that birthed this idea in her mind.<br></p>
        <p>This innovation is centered on kids because of their capacity to learn fast when they are young. It will help kids, between the ages of 3 and 15, explore their potentials in the fast growing world run by science and technology.</p>
        <p>We seek to train kids to be great inventors who will contribute positively to the growth of the nation and the world at large.</p>
        <p>This encourages them to think outside the box and beyond.</p></aside>
